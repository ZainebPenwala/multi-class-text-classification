Bank Bailout,okay right uh feeling caused S L crisis guess real technical knowledge happened gather large number situation loan made appear good loan speculative since little regulation going deregulation Reagan eight year uh S L simply began take riskier riskier loan began collapse one think almost like avalanche property value devalued um-hum kind like domino 's effect right i- n't field whether equivalent called teapot dome uh scandal familiar history lesson whatever uh vaguely recall 've never gone done study since S L thing teapot dome scandal think Hoover year gob land sold really inflated price theory natural gas beneath appeared corruption within Hoover administration n't real since like corruption caused S L though feeling people look way thing began go sour um-hum n't think really corruption caused maybe within think people started know no- careful loan making whenever y- know whenever gave uh-huh think maybe n't check enough maybe everyone else figured would go ahead approve also yeah yeah seems like awful lot people making loan business decision get rich quick wrong phrase capture feeling people making business decision failed 's sort well skin back 'll move company um-hum um-hum i- since n't commitment stability organization making decision n't know whether 's opportunity could move um-hum know easy find new work n't n't stuck thing begin collapse moved 'm sure whether extracted enough money percentage base n't n't care 'm rather puzzled whole thing um-hum know well 'm um know little bit n't much know 'm finance major Clarion okay um know one reason caused fact federal reserved backed loan Savings L made hundred thousand dollar kind insured hundred thousand dollar think 's kind making riskier loan like oh well hundred thousand dollar insurance well n't n't since risk n't think oh okay uh plus fact allowed make loan almost type loan like bank know 're limited type loan 're allowed make uh-huh think S L 's open type loan allowed make okay think would bound certain loan high insurance reserve n't think would happened well think 's final accounting yet since penny nickel think 's accounting ordered magnitude really understand much money awhile seemed like every time opened paper escalating term damage uh sense understand bad um-hum heard yet um think people basically got tired hearing making n't good news think 's still a- know

's 's possible go future caught land slide um-hum um-hum think possibly 'll happen regular bank i- n't know thin- think would harder think regular bank go seems recall reading last oh let 's say starting three year ago much last year bank risk relative loaning fund third world country like Mexico Venezuela um-hum uh Argentina based oil loan price oil gone south resulting loan risky guess read article various bank done right thing contain risk given made multiple billion dollar loan vague since could happen still monies loaned third world country could end totally lost oh yeah um class rea- think Venezuela ca n't remember company wrote like million dollar know never get back um-hum know wrote right think think 've lost lot money know like every never going get back 's impossible get back think 's gone um-hum um-hum yeah we- 're know 're talking company like even gave getting back 're even trying okay totally wrote book think necessary federal guaranty program like since try protect small investor ended protecting big investor hum n't think meant guess feel like long possibility large number people protected possibility exists sort problem um-hum um yeah think necessary um backing um 's 's know safe purpose know case something would happen um yeah long 's enough little company 're going something um since uh loan guarantee really account guaranty account holder something went wrong would money um-hum right given S L 's disaster account holder money still protected um-hum 's million people anywhere thousand ten thousand guess um-hum dollar protected seems like um lot money protected multiple account uh 's take ten million people protect ten thousand dollar still hundred bi- billion dollar 're taking monies way access 's obvious 've protected large

account thirty five different S L 's thirty forty thousand dollar 're protected government seems like 've gotten around intended issue uh-huh guess n't personal sense vulnerability since heavy user S L 's let alone went bankrupt um-hum guess mean perspective could happen mean mean 'm worried enough think could happen yeah uh 's kind thing maybe 'll survive happen n't pay attention kind thing um-hum think 'll happen think 'll long time future happen think like bank people kind people like gon na worried let happen near future think later 're gon na start forget start making riskier loan mean 're gon na take risk long 're backed think 're still gon na know start taking riskier loan think chance possibly happen know late know future uh-huh well perhaps regulatory um constraint put back

Taxes,okay uh general opinion tax Americans um n't think 'm paying many tax know much tax yeah uh uh far uh know federal state uh uh state live five percent sale tax um-hum uh 's quite bit different uh Texas n't know 've ever outside Texas uh moved Texas told oh well 's personal income tax well nail property tax uh Texas 's get money take care school thing right yeah uh matter fact 're talking changing tax situation Texas school 're equitable within state 're changing 're talking changing uh tax base tax distributed school probably mean uh another increase property tax either uh starting state income tax yeah i- found interesting uh moved Texas fact uh reason people wanted get kid Plano go Plano school district best money know place uh um uh like Maryland uh bought uh house hundred forty one thousand 'd sixty thousand um tax basis actually uh le full price house uh-huh end paying property tax value house think house valued probably ninety hundred thousand dollar yeah whereas Texas notice put tax basis almost uh full price almost full value right yeah quite difference yeah um think way levy tax little bit uh crazy think uh people 'll use Plano example uh house price Plano falling decided well order get tax revenue 're going raise price uh know 're going raise uh uh tax per hundred dollar value house um-hum time approving new start home hand fist well start large supply home course price go know value house going fall existing family home one falling new home building cheaper able sell cheaper people n't buying existing family home right right shooting foot know would thought well gee n't know put freeze new home start bring price house back tax base revenue go wo n't increase tax make burden people living yeah guess 's possibility uh understand Maryland uh state income tax right state income tax oh okay yeah 's uh divide um know pay state income tax fifty percent state income tax county tax collected state redistributed county okay uh state income tax deductible federal income tax purpose correct okay live Texas uh stopped letting deduct uh sale tax tax return um yes lived Texas eighty seven um eighty eight uh part eighty nine okay could n't deduct state inco- uh state sale tax lived Texas think difference two situation um Texas oh believe uh t- sale tax somewhere around seven eight eight percent um-hum Maryland 's five um nice uh know deduction available yeah uh revamped know supposedly making thing fair um 've heard lot different argument uh pro con whether allow deduction sale tax even uh maybe put emphasis sale tax think people purchase item one better able pay tax right know people barely struggling pay uh house payment buy food n't going buying know anything else people know uh disposable income probably able pay income tax uh pay sale tax one really know money 're buying item maybe know paying burden um wa- 's another crazy thing get 's like child le tax pay completely crazy five child mean know uh know 's kind odd talk people n't make sense 're getting service yeah yeah um-hum know child going know 've got five child school instead somebody one none 're paying income tax pay child go school know n't make sense yeah 's 's interesting uh interesting concept n't thought know 's right guess sense guess know idea uh people family allowance need know uh capability need uh pay food clothing stuff give allowance dependent allowance um-hum uh know understand 're 're coming yeah side question getting 're paying um part think lot inefficiency uh federal level state level uh hopefully we'll know start go computerization process maybe 'll able streamline yeah um n't kept uh Texas politics dirty little uh governor fight yeah mean uh governor Maryland 's uh pretty hard nosed uh 's know 're three hundred fifty million dollar short every time come plan cut money everybody start screaming yelling um-hum uh every time want cut one budget something else try something know start screaming yelling wo n't let raise tax wo n't let cut program 's like guy want right yeah 's guess uh one thought occurred uh 're 're talking uh national uh military public service deal young people um-hum maybe program like could replace uh welfare program uh know 're going ought really get benefit dollar benefit uh reduce spending area uh know something eliminate uh refer transfer payment yes uh 's think 's real know real problem government government 's 's spending money 's 's encouraging people uh well know uh much output 're paying people work 're paying people kid know like said know kid dependent know allowance get uh uh aid dependent child get thing go yeah uh kind national service uh concept might geared around reducing would think would big step yeah think uh putting emphasis local handling problem think something Bush came said uh address uh nation beginning year right um know used community would take care know state would take care community sudden everybody starting looking federal government right uh uh know start top try get dollar hand need know 's lot place money stop disappears along way right uh maintenance overhead know kind cost yeah right i- think big part uh know government concept last fifty year uh redistribution uh wealth effect um-hum uh know tax people people n't anything get nothing yeah uh n't think 's American way uh kind ring know socialism yeah n't understand American

enough tax paying much uh middle class uh upper class wealthy people paying enough uh-huh think le- ought legislation make make equitable uh depending much earn like progressive income tax yeah sure uh-huh think everybody ought paying fair share still many loophole available get well well thought closed uh loophole came uh pretty well constant fixed tax type uh well know 're right primarily thing supposed longer tax deductible first second home mortgage interest yeah right think still real estate oriented type tax hedge cut back rental property income yeah uh ca n't uh get uh tax deduction uh say second third fourth house paying uh tax yeah well 's rich see uh certainly second third fourth fifth house right also cut back thing like limited partnership right uh way loophole left 're talking well maximum tax bracket twenty eight percent right well thirty three 're hump nobody pay higher right yeah uh uh uh felt like ought cut capital gain tax think 's right agree fo- finally tax cut make little investor like capable 're able set aside little money aside little investing make buck without getting taken away sure ought get salary taxed 're able save money able invest stock bond various thing like get stuck seems little bit unfair right 'm saying way tax structured right encourage saving really n't hand um would change encourage saving um well 's good question go back thing like tax free IRAs like wound coming back yeah agree 's uh okay yeah thought good move certainly yeah think wish would 'm bracket right take advantage IRA getting tax deduction hear used able uh ca n't 's also problem 've got contribution tax deductible n't keep separate yeah right yeah 's absolutely unfair agree seems like every time Congress uh presidency get set like see 's kind tax cut 'm necessarily broad range tax cut salary much tax cut n't tax saving various kind know saving 're willing tie money least minimum period time s- uh minimum number year like like IRAs uh reasonable alternative average person get rich alone yeah uh uh seems like every time uh people begin make little money lot people jumped IRAs mean di- app- apparently lot people know oh still contribute IRA even though ca n't take advantage tax break yeah yeah well 'm one seems like soon uh got going like gangbusters Congress saw big pile money beginning form wanted come tax sure uh 's would uh uh police spending uh-huh n't know n't know else mean seems like constantly reelecting Republican president Democratic Congresses Democratic president Republican Congresses ca n't ever seem get together yeah well think one thing may maybe en- encourage uh saving small way ca n't write tax personal spending uh may keep may cause recession well though keep people going going charging credit card uh max right cut uh much uh spending going uh year think latest interest cu- rate cut Fed went going uh get people back spending 'm sure uh 're still uh recession uh ta- cut th- prime encouraged activity market yet yeah uh-huh uh-huh think people going follow stock market take uh 's good indicator economy turning around people going start spending right lot people fearful job well oh yeah know exactly feel lot layoff uh know unemployment 's way uh 're saving money uh thing get better right uh-huh uh-huh uh talking fellow today seemed think going make difference said hey lot people ready borrowed hilt n't care cut low cut tax ca n't afford borrow anymore wo n't want try get handle tha- 've got cut drastically uh idea refinancing lower interest rate becomes thing right well say mortgage payment charge many point order refinance lot people ca n't afford yeah 's right le break considerable interest rate cut say eleven percent mortgage nine percent mortgage 's enough 've got get eight maybe even seven half yeah well 's basically 're right uh people lot people eleven percent mortgage get nine percent cost three point yeah 's enough need eight percent loan able three percent yeah three percent mo- mortgage right uh principal 's left loan uh significant chunk change 's right uh lot people n't n't position take advantage 'm sure uh cutting interest rate going cutting tax either think 've gotten uh gone uh uh period time 've credit hungry um gotten uh uh limb debt uh federal debt consumer debt uh 'm really concerned whether kind taxation one way going make difference yeah well another thing uh kind irks
